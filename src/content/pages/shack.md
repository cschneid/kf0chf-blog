## Radios

### ICOM 7300

This was an amazing deal for my first radio. It does everything I want as I
explore the various angles of ham radio, without much hassle.

I've done digital (FT8, JS8Call, RTTY) by just connecting a USB cable to my
old windows laptop, I've done SSB, listened to CW (uselessly), all with a
great UI and a pretty waterfall.

### Yaesu FTM-400

Pretty screen, higher power than my handhelds. Lets me hit the Colorado
Connection repeater a fair ways away.

### Yaesu FT-3DR

Amazing handheld, pretty screen, easy UI and menus.

### Baofeng BF-F8HP

Everybody's gotta have one. This is what I listened to before I had my
license. Sat on my shelf and I listened on and off for a year before finally
getting my tech license.

## Antennas

### Diamond X30A

I've been impressed by the performance of this $100 antenna. I have it mounted on a 10 foot pole (metal conduit purchased at home depot), held up by my patio table's umbrella hole.

### Super Antenna MP1

A portable vertical antenna. I've been impressed by it, when mounted on my back porch in suburban noise, it has reached all the way to Japan, East Coast, California, Mexico, and Pacific Northwest. It has a *huge* skip zone though, I've never heard anybody in Colorado, Utah, Kansas, Nebraska and so on.

## Misc

### Pi-Star digital hotspot

Generic one I bought off Amazon

### NanoVNA

Generic one I bought off Ebay. A very impressive little machine.
