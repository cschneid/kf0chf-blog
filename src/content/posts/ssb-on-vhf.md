## Motivation

A group of people (with W0XLD leading the way) in Colorado are experimenting with
doing JS8Call over VHF frequencies. JS8Call only works on Single Side Band
mode though, not FM modulations.

I wanted to get involved, but found that my rather nice Yaesu FTM-400 didn't
support any modes other than FM and Yaesu's digital (YSF / C4FM) modes. So I
started doing some research on what would work, and for what kind of prices.

## Options

### Buying a New Radio

One easy option of course is buying a new radio which supports the modes I
want. For the most part, these are combo HF and VHF units, and many are out
of production now. The ICOM 9700 is the only dedicated VHF & UHF radio that
supports all these modes, but it's pretty pricy.

**VHF Radios that do Single Side Band:**

- ICOM 705 (QRP)
- ICOM 706 (QRP) (Discontinued?)
- ICOM 7100
- ICOM 9700
- ICOM 9100 (Discontinued)
- Yaesu 991A
- Yaesu FT-817 (QRP) (Discontinued)
- Yaesu FT-818 (QRP)
- Yaesu FT-857D (Discontinued)
- Yaesu FT-897D (Discontinued)
- Kenwood TS2000 (Discontinued)

I'm sure other radios are out there that do SSB and I'd love to be told about
them so I can add to the list.

The best option would be a cheaper ($200-$600) radio that was focused on VHF / UHF,
instead of a all-band one that's more expensive, but as far as I can tell, it
doesn't exist.

### Transverter

This takes an HF radio's output, (on 28mhz or similar), which is easy to
encode as SSB, and converts it to VHF frequencies. They don't seem very
common, but I have one on order from [Transverters Store](https://transverters-store.com/144mhz_tcxo_assembled_with_att.htm),
via their Ebay page (which looks like it's cheaper than buying directly?)

The downside is that you need an HF radio already, and the transverter's
power output is pretty low compared to a dedicated VHF radio. This one is
rated to only goes up to 15 watts.

## Other Notes

I found this great [presentation about Weak Signals](https://www.zaarc.org/Weak_Signals_WB4OMG_presentation.pdf)
by WB4OMG that goes over some of the various behaviors & expectations for SSB
and other weak signal work over VHF, UHF, and SHF frequencies.
